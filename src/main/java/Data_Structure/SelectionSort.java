//Selection Sort: Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
// This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts,
// the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end.
// Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
//
//The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element,
//and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted
// array boundary by one element to the right.
//
//This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities
// are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
