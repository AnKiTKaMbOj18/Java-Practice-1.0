//Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.

//Binary Tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes.
// A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children.
// A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is
// as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.
